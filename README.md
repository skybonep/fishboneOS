# fishboneOS: A Highly Modular OS Toolkit

fishboneOS is a developer-centric system built from discrete, interchangeable components. It is designed to provide complete control and flexible ways to connect different system pieces together, acknowledging that while building an OS is an "insane journey," the architecture should not get in your way.

## Why use fishboneOS?
- Build Your Own System: Select specific components to assemble a custom environment tailored to your project’s requirements.

- Fully Replaceable Architecture: Every component of the system is interchangeable. In fishboneOS, even the kernel is treated as a module that can be swapped or updated, similar to a "loosely-coupled monitor".

- Reliability and Clear Design: Development prioritizes a stable and understandable codebase over raw performance, ensuring the architecture remains manageable as the system grows.

- A Developer’s Sandbox: An "on-the-metal" testing ground for researchers and developers to experiment with new algorithms, drivers, and unique system architectures.

- Focused Fundamentals: By starting with a minimal, robust base, the project ensures that the core logic remains accessible for deep research and technical contribution.
