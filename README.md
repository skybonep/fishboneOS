# fishboneOS
**fishboneOS** is a simple system made of small, separate parts. You can pick the pieces you like and put them together to build your own custom system. Every piece can be changed or replaced easily. It is built for user choice and simple connections. We are starting with a small base to grow a project that is easy to use.
